 * Counting Sundays
Problem 19
You are given the following information, but you may prefer 
to do some research for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, 
but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during 
the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
